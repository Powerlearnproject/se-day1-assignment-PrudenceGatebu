#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of principles or instructions in designining, developing, testing, deploying and management of software. It involves writting instructions(coding), building apps,games and websites and solving real world problems.
importance of software engineering in technology includes;
It leads to efficiency and productivity in that software engineering makes it easier for people in tech to complete their work with lots of ease and accurately.
Software engineering increases reliability and security in tech industries by ensuring minimal bugs and enhancing data protection.
Software engineering drives innovation and automatoin in the tech space, this is made possible by use of AI and automation of repetitive tasks.
Scalability is made possible where through software enginnering there ths been development of applications that can grow with the increse of the numbers of users.
Cost reduction where software engineering avoind costly errors caused by system disfunctions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering, this happened in 1968 . This led to the introduction of structured programming, methodology and best practice for software engineering.
The rise of Object Oriented Programming. This happened in the 1980s . The OPP allowed the developers to create complex software systems more efficiently .
The Agile Revolution(2001-Present).  This was a response to the limitation of traditional model such aas the waterfall approach. Agile methodology enphasizes on fletibility, collaboration, and continuous development. This development has increased the success rate of projects, reduced time to market, efficiency, reliability and innovation in software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-This is where we define the project goal,feasibility, scope, risks and time.
Requirement analysis- Look at the bussiness needs, user documents.
Design-Where one creates the architecture, database structure and interface designs.
Implementation- this is the coding stage based on the design. Use specific coding languages.
Testing stage- This is where we identify the bugs in the systems, It involves unit testing, intergration testing and system testing.
Deployment stage- this is where the software is realeased to the users for use in a live environmemt.
Maintainance- This is made possible through updates, bugfixes amd improvements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile method is flexible while waterfall method is rigid, this is because Agile method is grouped into stages hence changes can be made with ease compated to the waterfall method.
Agile method is suitable for complex and evolving projects while waterfall method is suitable for small well defined projects.
Agile method testing is done throughout the development process while in waterfall it only happens once development is done .
Agile method is less risky compared to the waterfall method this is because Agile method there are continuous development aand adjustments done which is not the same case to Waterfall method where the changes are made once a project is complete.
In both the methods are used in software development in projects both ensuring phases like planning, design, devepopment,testing and deployment.
Both methods are goal-oriented where they all aim to develop a project of high quality that meets user requirement.
Both requre testing to fish out any bugs in the system.
In both Project Management Principles like timeliness, milestones and stakeholders involvement are required and followed.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The roles of a software developer is to write, test and maintain the code to build a functionable software application,  and responsibilities of a software engineer include; Designing,coding and debugging software applications. Collaboratin with team members to get the needs otf the project. Writting clean , efficient and maintainable codes . Kepping up with the new trends and development in software engineering.
The roles and responsibilities of a quality assuarance engineer includes; the role is that he or she ensures that the software meet the quality standards and functiond before deployment. The key responsibilities are developing and executing test plans, cases and scripts. Identifying, documenting and reporting software defects. Performing the diffrent types of testing(unit, intergration, system and user acceptance test). Ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practice and Automating test practice for efficiency.
The roles of a project manager is to oversee the planning, execution, and completion of the software project and ensuring the are delivered on time and within the budget.
The key responsibilities are ; Definig the project, scope and goals. Maanaging the timeliness , resources and budgets. Communicating with the stake holders and team members. Identifying and mitigating project risks and Ensuring project compleation and evluating the outcomes.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a software tool that provide developers with unified environment to write, test and debug code efficiently. The importance include; to increase productivity, ensure efficiency in debugging , ensure code management and enhance intergration with other tools. The examples of IDEs include VS Codes, Eclipse, pycharm.
Version Control System  is a tool tha tracks the changes in a code hence maintaining history of modifications. The importance includes ensuring collaboration, change tracking to return to previous versions, enables branching and merging options to developers and also enables backup and recovery of data by keeping track of all changes. the examples of VCS Include Git, Subversion, Mercurial and Perforce.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenge includee debugging and fixing the bugs which can be time consuming and complex. A strategy tha can be used is to ensure unit testing for early detection and the use of debugging tools like the breakpoint ,logging.
A challenge of keeping up with new and ever changing technology , this can be mitigated by ensuring the developers keep on lerning to get the knowledge and collaboration.
A challenge of managing tight deadlines can be managed by using methodologies like Agile that break the projects into small tasks .
A challenge of security , where an engineer can face cyber threats or data breaches can be managed through using secure coding pracices and conducting regular security audits.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves the testing of specifc individual components or functions of d software application. The importance is that it detects the bugs at an early stage , improves the quality of the modularity in quality assuarance. 
Intergration testing is done between the intergrated modules to ensure that they work together effectively . The importance is that it detects interface defects and ensure a smooth flow of data between interface.
System testing involves the evaluation of the complete application to veryfy if it meets the business requirements . The importance is detecting the system- wide defects and vaalidate the functionality aganist the requirements.
Acceptance Testing is a test that determines if the softwate meets thee business needs and if its ready for use. This is done to ensure customer satisfaction and reducing the deployment defects.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining instructions to effectively interact with AI models so as to achieve the desired response . The importance of Prompt engineering is enhancing AI Respons quality, to improve the efficiency and productivity when using th AI, Enhance creativity and innovation, facilitates a better interraction between huma and the AI and also supports the AI ethics and safety.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague question example is , "Tell me about finance"
A clear and improved prompt " Provide an overview of the mmain areas in finance , including personal finance, corporate finance and investment banking, with examples of their applications.
The improved version is effective coz it clearly defines the scope- the area of finance it should be included.
It has request for examples this makes the response more practical.
It has ensured relevance where the user will recieve a structured response tha provides useful insights.
